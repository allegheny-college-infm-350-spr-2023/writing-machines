## Summary



## Goals

* Explore pure code as an expressive medium
* Gain an introduction to Javascript, particularly the `nodeJS`/`ES6` varieties
* Highlight differences and similarities between Javascript and Python
* Engage with developing "writing machines"

## Outcomes

* 2 poems which engage the idea of writing machines and programming languages
  * 1 which is a remix of "Taroko Gorge"
  * 1 which presents an original writing machine
* 1 of these must be written in Javascript
* 1 of these must be written in Python

## Process

This repository contains two (2) files essential to making this assignment "happen". They are all contained in the `src` folder.

### `main.py`
